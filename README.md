Comparison of K-means and Hierarchical clustering in the penguins dataset
---

Python code which looks at clustering bill length and bill depth in the Penguins dataset. 

For the example uploaded the data did not need to be scaled before creating the clusters but for other
examples you may want to scale the data before generating the clusters.

Please note for anyone who has completed the Andrew Ng course on Machine Learning he describes clustering
as more of an art than a science whereby you may have some prior reason or knowledge on the clusters e.g.
you are looking to group your data into three sizes (maybe small, medium and large) in this case the above
two approaches are extremely useful.
